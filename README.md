This app will display a list of upcoming video games taken from the Giant Bomb api and will allow the user to search for specific games that wish to know the release day of. It will also show the original release day of games that have already been released. By clicking on a specific game the user will be transported to the giantbomb article specific to it allowing them to receive further information about the game they selected. Clicking the title will reset the app and take the user back to the original page.

!!!!ADDED FUNCTIONALITY!!!!

Now with VG Release Chart, users can register and log into their own accounts and can create their very own wishlist of games. Once a user arrives at the homepage they will notice that there is a register and log in button at the top right of the screen. For added convenience there is already a pre-registered user profile called default. Once the user has logged in they will be able to add games to their wishlist by clicking the corresponding button on the bottom of each game profile. From the homepage the user can then go to their own custom wishlist and see the games that have been stored as well as remove any game from the list if they choose to do so.
